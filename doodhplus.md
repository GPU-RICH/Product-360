- Transcription: Hello, friends. I am Tejas Rajangra Vairalkar from Nodoa, Modawa Taluka, Buldhana District. My mobile number is 87883397, and the date for Nodoa is 218230. I was introduced to Dehat Company by Mr. Rishikesh Nikam, who recommended I try Dehat Company's Milk Plus and Mineral Mixture. Initially, I bought four or five buckets, each weighing about one kilogram. Since then, I have noticed a shine on the animals' skin, and there has been visible improvement in the coat. The milk production per animal has increased by around 1.5 to 2 liters, and fat content has also shown an increase. I have also recommended this to some of my farmer friends, and the results have been positive. Thank you.

- Transcription: For the past 10-15 years, we've been taking great care of them, feeding them extensively. We provide them with minerals, and only the supplements you provide. We've benefited greatly from this. The milk fat is around 3%, and it has also increased our milk production capacity. This feed is excellent; give it, and production will increase significantly. Thank you!

- Transcription: Hello, farmer friends! Today, we have with us Mr. Sanjay Sah, who has used Dehat Company’s Milk Plus. Let’s hear from him about Milk Plus. Hello, Mr. Sanjay! Please tell us about Milk Plus. You have fed it to your cows—what benefits have you observed? Could you share your experience?
Mr. Sanjay explains that after using it, he has noticed an increase in fat content in the milk, which has also led to an improvement in the milk's quality. When the fat percentage rises, the milk’s rate also increases, providing better value. For other farmers, he recommends using Milk Plus Mineral Powder. You can see his cows here, and since he started feeding them this supplement, he has seen an increase in fat, which has helped him get a good price at the milk collection center. Thank you, Mr. Sanjay!
