- Transcription: Hello, my name is Krishnapal Chouhan, and I am from Dehaat Company. Today, we’ve come to meet you, Sandeep Chouhan ji, to discuss our Dehaat Khurak (animal feed). Could you tell me if you have dairy animals? Sandeep ji replied, "Yes, sir, I have a Gir cow and some cross-bred cattle." I then asked about the current feeding routine: "Alright, so what are you feeding them? Are you giving them any cottonseed mix?" He mentioned that initially, he had been feeding them half a kilo of cottonseed mixed with other feed. I continued, "Could you tell me what kind of results you’ve observed with Khurak 3000? Have you noticed any changes in the animals or their milk?" Sandeep ji responded positively, saying, "Yes, sir, it’s been excellent. Really outstanding results with Khurak 3000."
We then decided to do a quick demo with the Gir cow standing nearby to see if she eats the feed eagerly. Sandeep ji placed a small amount of feed in her trough, and I asked how many bags he has fed her so far, to which he replied, "We have fed her seven bags." I also inquired about the source of the feed, and he confirmed they were purchasing it from the Dehaat center in Khargone. I suggested, "Moving forward, we would also like you to try feeding her Khurak 5000 and see if you observe any further changes." Finally, we took one last look at the cow, who seemed to be eating well. Thanking Sandeep ji, we concluded the visit with positive observations.

- Transcription: Hello, brother, I am Krishnapal Chouhan from Dehaat. Could you please introduce yourself? Today, we’re here to discuss animal feed with you. Could you tell me if you keep dairy animals, and if so, how many? What kind of feed are you giving them? I understand you previously tried different feeds available in the market before switching to Khurak 3000. You mentioned that the other feeds didn’t give notable results, which led you to use oilcake, though it turned out to be costly. To reduce expenses, you’re now using Khurak 3000, providing 2 kg to high-yield cows and 1.5 kg to medium-yield cows, along with some oilcake. For cows giving 8–10 liters of milk, you feed around 4 kg of Khurak 3000 mixed with some oilcake, adjusting based on milk production.
Are you satisfied with Dehaat’s Khurak 3000? Would you recommend it to other farmers who are in the dairy business or keep dairy animals? You replied that, while there are many types of feed available, Dehaat’s Khurak 3000 has shown great results. It helps reduce costs and has led to improvements in milk production compared to other feeds on the market. Although oilcake gives slightly higher results, Khurak 3000 is much more economical with similar benefits, making it an excellent option overall. Thank you very much, brother!

3. Benefits Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q55lYWMu40o
- Transcription: Hello, my name is Arjan Soni, and I am an Area Business Manager at Dehaat, working in Khandwa. Today, we are joined by Mr. Raju, who is the director of our Dehaat cattle feed operations. We’re here to understand how joining Dehaat has impacted him and made his business easier.
Hello, my name is Raju Patel, speaking from Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh. Previously, my business mainly involved selling oilcake, specifically cottonseed oilcake. But since I joined Dehaat about a year ago, I have greatly benefited from various services. For instance, when I place an order, it is conveniently delivered to my shop by evening if placed in the morning, making my work much easier. Earlier, I only sold oilcake, but now, after partnering with Dehaat, I can offer Khurak animal feed to farmers, which has allowed me to expand my product line.
Additionally, Dehaat has started offering veterinary services through video calls, allowing us to consult directly with veterinarians whenever there’s an issue with our livestock. I’ve personally used this service, and some farmers have found it very helpful, as it provides free, expert advice. I am grateful to Dehaat for these benefits.
Your feedback is valuable to us, and we’re eager to explore how we can further improve and strengthen our services in your area. We look forward to advancing together, and we appreciate the time you’ve taken to meet with us. Thank you very much, and we extend our thanks to the Dehaat team as well.
